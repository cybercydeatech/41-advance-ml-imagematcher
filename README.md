# Machine Learning Workshop - Demo 2

## Difficulty: Medium

## Description

I trained a CNN to recognize ten different classes of images. The other day, someone approached me and said: "Don't you know DEFCON is a BIRD? Your model is broken!"

Unfortunately, my model seems to classify the DEFCON logo as a deer. Can you fix it?
